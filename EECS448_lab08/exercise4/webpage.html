            The View From Halfway Down <br>
            <br>
            The weak breeze whispers nothing <br>
            the water screams sublime. <br>
            His feet shift, teeter-totter <br>
            deep breaths, stand back, it’s time. <br>
            <br>
            Toes untouch the overpass <br>
            soon he’s water-bound. <br>
            Eyes locked shut but peek to see <br>
            the view from halfway down. <br>
            <br>
            A little wind, a summer sun <br>
            a river rich and regal. <br>
            A flood of fond endorphins <br>
            brings a calm that knows no equal. <br>
            <br>
            You’re flying now, you see things <br>
            much more clear than from the ground. <br>
            It's all okay, or it would be <br>
            were you not now halfway down. <br>
            <br>
            Thrash to break from gravity <br>
            what now could slow the drop? <br>
            All I’d give for toes to touch <br>
            the safety back at top. <br>
            <br>
            But this is it, the deed is done <br>
            silence drowns the sound. <br>
            Before I leaped I should've seen <br>
            the view from halfway down. <br>
            <br>
            I really should’ve thought about <br>
            the view from halfway down. <br>
            I wish I could've known about <br>
            the view from halfway down—
